# Poor Bunny

Python 2.7/3 port of [Bunny1(bunnylol)](https://github.com/ccheever/bunny1)

## Description

> bunny1 is a tool that lets you write smart bookmarks in python and then share them across all your browsers and with a 
group of people or the whole world. It was developed at Facebook and is widely used there.

So is poor bunny...

This is a simplified version for bunny1, easy to use as a single machine application (or you can deploy it to cloud, if
you like..) You can treat your brower address tab as a CLI and config commands in it! and ... you do it in Python!
'''PYTHON FOR EVERYONE'''

## To Run It...

Open your console
> python poorbunny.py [--port PORT]
 
The default port will be 10086

And follow the instructions on [bunny1](http://www.bunny1.org/) to setup your browser.

## Futher Plan

This stuff is faaaaar from complete. System tray application? More flexible command config? ... yeah better coding style
